# About me

Growing up as my parents struggled to open businesses in a [country](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/economic-freedom/map?geozone=world&page=map&year=2015&countries=BRA) with harsh restrictions on entrepreneurship taught me how valuable and rare freedom is. As I dived into the study of economics and solutions to world problems that did not require state coercion, I learned that there is a sea of entrepreneurs, specially in poverty ridden areas, with an enormous drive to build new things that simply give up once they learn about barriers imposed on them.

I also learned that our voting system is [severely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_voting_in_Brazil) flawed and for that reason it's use was made illegal in most first world countries that opted for more auditable but slower solutions. When I noticed that a good voting system has not yet been built I decided build [one](github.com/mtsalenc/ethervoltz) on Ethereum as my graduation project. While it [got published](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6348247992734089217) on a local conference, it does not scale. For this reason I am currently researching a solution that uses truebit to run and verify all transactions in a plasma chain and only commit proofs to the mainnet.

# Professional Work
I have one and a half year of professional work as a fulltime developer. I worked on fullstack applications [1], cross-platform mobile applications [2] and native android applications. I work daily with OracleDB and MySql.

[1] Java EE, Primefaces, JSF, Hibernate, .NET MVC Entity Framework.

[2] Xamarin with Xamarin.forms, Unity Engine.

# Personal Work
I am very curious. Before I became a software developer I had an interest in [3D modelling and animation](https://deltabit.wordpress.com/2014/05/29/previous-work/) on Blender, so I read all tutorials I came across on the subject.

From software development and 3d art came [Fiend Fender](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deltabit.fiendfender). A 3d tower defense game built on unity.

[SimpleWallet](https://github.com/mtsalenc/simple-wallet) Built with truffle, it's backend is deployed on the rinkeby testnet and it's frontend on angular is deployed on swarm.

# Academic work
I hold a Udacity Nanodegree in android development and built [serveral](https://github.com/mtsalenc/popular-movies) [applications](https://github.com/mtsalenc/comperio) during my course. The most relevant are on my github.

I will finish my BEng. Computer in May this year. It is a sandwich diploma because I received a scholarship to study abroad for one year at BME University in Budapest.

# Notes on my application
While researching, I came across [this](https://pastebin.com/bSuVDswu). It helped me understand what each function is supposed to do but I left empty what I didn't understand well. If you think there is a possibility I am a good match for the position and would like to see more code, I would gladly fill them.

Application:
`git clone https://github.com/mtsalenc/aragon-payroll.git`

Thank you for your time and consideration.
